		<p>The primary goal of this site is for users to be able to find and look at recipes. The difference between this site and a cookbook is the ability for users to search for recipes using ingredients they already have.  There will be links on all recipe pages allowing users to share them on their social media, and/or their user profile page. Users will also be able to upload their favorite recipes that they wish to share with other users of our website.</p>
